SpookRank is a horror movie ranking algorithm, that takes user ratings on pre-selected horror movies. Specific criteria are analyzed, such as the use of cheap jump scares, special effect quality, and overall enjoyability. Users' ratings are stored to a database, and this data is also used to rank and display average values of each movies' scores.

The primary algorithm at work is the ranking and analysis of user's input ratings.

The languages used are Ruby on Rails, and SQLite

This application would be marketed because of its anonymity features. Users do not need to, and in fact cannot login to modify their past reviews. Each review is 'set-in-stone,' giving it more gravity and permanence in the user's mind. Additionally, applications such as snapchat and yikyak were successful, billion dollar IPs because they were an existing feature (messaging between friends, messaging with nearby strangers; respectively) that added a layer of artificial anonymity. This same added anonymity is the end-purpose of SpookRank, when compared to something like RottenTomatoes. Additionally, there are no paid users, and everybody's opinion is weighted equally, so there are no critits overpowering the voice of the people.
